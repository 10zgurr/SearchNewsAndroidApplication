In my project, I have used Android Jetpack new architecture components which are:

- Databinding
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- Lifecycles
- Androidx

With these all above features, you can build more reliable and High-Quality Android apps and you can write more flexible and easier codes with Kotlin language.
For these reasons, I have written my project with Kotlin language and have built it on MVVM architecture.
If you review the project you can see all these features and how to use them in an Android project.

Plus, I have used some 3rd party libraries,

To connect RESTFUL APIs:

- Retrofit
- OkHttp

And for app design:

- Androidx Recyclerview
- Androidx Cardview
- Androidx Constraintlayout
- Glide



*This sample Android application uses "https://newsapi.org" RESTFUL API services.
